# Context

The FAIRiCUBE Hub provides a complete working environment where users can access algorithms and data remotely to obtain computing resources and tools that they might not otherwise have and avoid the need to download and manage large volumes of data. This new approach removes the need to transfer/download large e.g. Earth Observation data sets around the world, while increasing the analytical power available research scientists, industry, operational service providers, regional authorities, and policy analysts.

EOxHub is extended in two ways to provide the FAIRiCUBE *Collaborative Development Tools*:

* Extended support for teams as part of the multi-user plan. Allow for easier sharing of versioned notebooks and other artifacts within the team but not necessarily the public.
* Integrated support for Machine Learning (ML) workflows. This includes the versioning, sharing, and collaborative using of all ML artifacts like code, data, models, results, etc. Based on user feedback, the readily available Open-Source tools like Data Version Control (DVC), MLflow, Kubeflow, or similar, will be integrated during the project.

The [FAIRiCUBE Hub](hub.md) manages use cases and their users. The Hub provides for each use case a workspace or tenant,
assigns project resources, hosts project artifacts, provides a shared storage for result dissemination, and integrates team collaboration tools. It also controls visibility of results of individual user projects so that they can be made part of a FAIRiCUBE public portrayal.

A FAIRiCUBE user project comprises numerous own applications, interfaces, services, and data available in the provided workspace.
