# PyTorch Introduction

PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:

* Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
* Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.
