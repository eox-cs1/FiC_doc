# FAIRiCUBE Knowledge Base

Based on needs, experience and understanding of project use cases, the Knowledge Base provides a set of tools to enable appropriate knowledge of how to apply algorithms and ML techniques to solve similar demands.
The core task of the Knowledge Base (KB) is to provide to the community a set of tools, documents, algorithms, code, tips and tricks, mistakes to avoid, examples of use and so on.

The FAIRiCUBE Knowledge Base can be accessed at [FAIRiCUBE Knowledge Base](https://fairicube-kb.dev.epsilon-italia.it/)
